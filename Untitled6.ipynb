        "    The condition is evaluated at the start of each loop iteration, and if it is true, the loop body is executed.\n",
        "    The loop is terminated if the condition is false.\n",

        "  * For Loop:A for loop is a control flow statement in Python that allows you to iterate over a sequence of elements such as a list, tuple, or string.\n",
        "    On each iteration, the loop variable in Python will take on the value of the next item in the sequence.\n",
